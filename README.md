# Livestock-Commodity-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes livestock commodity data across Nepal's districts, focusing on milk production patterns and their relationship with various livestock populations. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling using linear regression.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Merges 8 distinct livestock datasets from different sources
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent district naming
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Includes correlation studies and statistical summaries
- **Visualizations**: Interactive plots (box plots, scatter plots, pie/bar charts) using Plotly
- **Predictive Modeling**: Linear regression to predict total milk production

## Dataset Sources
All datasets contain district-wise information about:
- Horse/asses population
- Milk animals and production
- Meat production
- Cotton production
- Egg production
- Rabbit population
- Wool production
- Yak/Nak/Chauri population
